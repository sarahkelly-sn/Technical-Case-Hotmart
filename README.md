## About The Project

This project is part of a technical case by Hotmart for the position of Data Analyst. The main goal is to demonstrate skills in data analysis, data manipulation, and logical reasoning.

* The challenge consists of answering six specific questions related to the performance of producers, products, and sales in the Hotmart database. The questions cover topics such as commission retention calculation, cancellation analysis, creator performance ranking, and comparison of products with and without recovery tools.

* To solve these questions, SQL queries will be used for data extraction and manipulation, Python scripts for creating and inserting tables, and Jupyter Notebook for presenting the results and detailed comments on each question.

- The challenge can be found [here](https://github.com/sarahkelly-sn/Technical-Case-Hotmart/blob/main/src/Challenge/Processo%20Seletivo%20-%20Technical%20Case.pdf).
- The data can be found [here](https://github.com/sarahkelly-sn/Technical-Case-Hotmart/blob/main/src/Data/SQL%20Datasets.zip).
- **The solution can be found [here](https://github.com/sarahkelly-sn/Technical-Case-Hotmart/blob/main/src/Solution/Technical%20Case%20Hotmart%20-%20Sarah%20Kelly.ipynb).**

## Getting Started

This repository was created to document and facilitate understanding of the Hotmart technical case. All details and analyses are available in the attached Jupyter Notebook file: [Link to the Notebook](https://github.com/sarahkelly-sn/Technical-Case-Hotmart/blob/main/src/Solution/Technical%20Case%20Hotmart%20-%20Sarah%20Kelly.ipynb).

### Opening the Notebook Online in Google Colab

To open the notebook online in Google Colab, follow these steps:

1. Access [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
2. Log in to your Google account if required.
3. Create a new notebook or open an existing one (`File -> Open notebook`).
4. Upload `.ipynb` file from Git repository by clicking [here](https://github.com/sarahkelly-sn/Technical-Case-Hotmart/blob/main/src/Solution/Technical%20Case%20Hotmart%20-%20Sarah%20Kelly.ipynb).
5. The file will load, and you can execute code cells as usual.

### Getting a Local Copy

To obtain a local copy and run the analyses yourself, follow these steps:

1. Upload `.ipynb` file from Git repository by clicking [here](https://github.com/sarahkelly-sn/Technical-Case-Hotmart/blob/main/src/Solution/Technical%20Case%20Hotmart%20-%20Sarah%20Kelly.ipynb).
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file available in the cloned folder.
3. Follow the detailed instructions in the notebook to view the SQL queries, data analysis, and insights obtained.

**This repository does not require any additional external dependencies beyond Jupyter Notebook to review the work done. If accessing through VS Code, ensure you have the Jupyter extension installed to open Jupyter Notebook files.**
