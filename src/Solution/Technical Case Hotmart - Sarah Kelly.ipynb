    "##### Common Table Expression (CTE) - Rankings\n",
    "\n",
    "The query begins with a CTE named Rankings, which calculates metrics for each producer (`producer_id`). The following fields are selected:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `producer_id`: Unique identifier of the producer.\n",
    "- `total_sales`: Total count of sales made by the producer in the year 2023.\n",
    "- `total_revenue`: Sum of total revenue generated by sales of the producer's products in 2023. This is calculated by multiplying the product price by the discount and service tax (if any).\n",
    "- `cancellation_rate`: Average cancellation rate of sales made by the producer. It calculates the average of the `cancelled` column from the Sales table, indicating whether the sale was cancelled.\n",
    "- `total_recovery_active`: Sum of recovery activation for the producer's products. This column comes from the Products table and indicates if sales recovery is active for each product.\n",
    "- `coupon_usage_rate`: Rate of coupon usage in sales made by the producer. It is calculated by dividing the sum of the `has_coupon` column from the Sales table by the total number of sales (`COUNT(s.purchase_id)`).\n",
    "- `chargeback_rate`: Rate of chargebacks in sales made by the producer. It is calculated by dividing the sum of the `chargeback` column from the Sales table by the total number of sales (`COUNT(s.purchase_id)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Final Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "In the final selection (`SELECT`), fields chosen to display in the final result include:\n",

    "- `total_revenue`: Total revenue generated.\n",
    "- `cancellation_rate`: Cancellation rate formatted to display as a percentage.\n",
    "- `coupon_usage_rate`: Coupon usage rate formatted to display as a percentage.\n",
    "- `chargeback_rate`: Chargeback rate formatted to display as a percentage.\n",
    "- `total_recovery_active`: Total activation of recovery.\n",
    "- `sales_rank`: Ranking of the producer based on total sales, ordered from highest to lowest (`DESC`).\n",
    "- `revenue_rank`: Ranking of the producer based on total revenue generated, ordered from highest to lowest (`DESC`).\n",
    "- `cancellation_rank`: Ranking of the producer based on cancellation rate, ordered from lowest to highest (`ASC`).\n",

    "##### Ordering\n",
    "\n",
    "Results are ordered first by `total_sales` in descending order to show producers with the most sales at the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Explanation of Indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Total Sales**: Indicates the total number of sales made by each producer in the year 2023.\n",
    "- **Total Revenue**: Shows the total revenue generated by sales of each producer's products in 2023, considering discounts and service fees.\n",
    "- **Cancellation Rate**: Average rate of sales cancellations for each producer. A lower rate indicates better customer retention.\n",
    "- **Coupon Usage Rate**: Percentage of sales that used discount coupons. Indicates the impact of coupons on the producer's sales strategy.\n",
    "- **Chargeback Rate**: Percentage of sales that resulted in chargebacks. A high rate may indicate issues with payment disputes.\n",
    "- **Total Recovery Active**: Sum of recovery activation for the producer's products, showing the use of this strategy to recover sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Percentage Formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "To display cancellation rate, coupon usage rate, and chargeback rate as percentages, the `FORMAT()` function is used to format the values multiplied by 100, with one decimal place (`'N1'`), and concatenated with the percentage symbol (`%`).\n",
    "\n",
